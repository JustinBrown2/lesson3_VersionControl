            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version control is a type of system that is capable of recording the changes that are made to a specific file or files. When there are a bunch of files being saved and changed over time version control is a good way to stay organized and recall specific versions. VCS allow multiple people to work on a project at one time and gives user the ability to revert back to old stages in the project or save multiple different versions and be able to recall it for later. VCS also allow users to see when something was last modified, by whom, and what was exactly done. If there is an essential error in files it is easy for users to revert back to early versions in their project. That is why lots of graphic and web designers use VCS systems. It is a handy tool that can save a lot of time and head ache. This topic is relevant to me because we will be using Git throughout the course. It is important that I understand Version Control Systems.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A common issue many people ran into is getting lost in which directory the user is in. A lot of people choose to copy files into another directory because it is very easy to do. Although it may be easy, it is also error prone. When users copy lots of files it is relatively easy to copy over files you don't mean to or even write in the wrong file. Local Version Control systems were created to deal with this issue by keeping track of all the changes to a file under revision control. Local Version Control essentially helps you stay organized and not get lost in the jumble of files that a user might create. This is interesting to me because it gives me a glipse of one type of VCS that caters toward an easier approach to VCS.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Centralized Version Control Systems cater toward developers that want to collaborate with other developers. There is one single server that holds all versions of the files and allow multiple users to view and work on. Centralized VCS have the edge over Local VCS in that certain users can be limited to making only certain changes and administrators have control over the files instead of dealing with the local databases of every client. Although, if the server goes down, clients are not capable of collaborating or saving any changes done to the files. Another downfall is that if the hard disk becomes corrupted, and proper backups were not implemented, all data is lost. This is interesting to me because this is something I see myself using to collaborate with others to create projects for work, or personal enjoyment.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Distributed Version Control Systems step in where the Centralized Version Control Systems fail. Instead of looking at the latest snapshot of the files in the system Distributed VCS mirror the repositories. It is capable of showing the files full history along with cloning files if the server dies at any point in time. Every clone is essentially a full back up stored in the file. More benefits include different models in which the user can work in. Not only can the user collaborate with other users, but they can collaborate with multiple groups in different ways within the same files. This is especially interesting because i feel like Distributed VCS are on the higher end. There seems to be more benefits here than other VCS.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Hub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Git is a type of VCS. This program sorts data in a series of snapshots inside of the file system. The three main commands used inside of Git is add, push, and commit. The way Git works is each time you use the commit command the program is essentially taking a snapshot of the users work. If no changes are applied and the user uses the commit command nothing is changed. It will not save useless information unless something is changed so meaningless files are not saved. The snapshots are saved as references that allow the user look at and tweak down the line and make changes as they feel necessary. Git is the go to VCS that we will be using in my Web Application Development course. We will be using Git throughout the year and I hope to get comfortable with it.
