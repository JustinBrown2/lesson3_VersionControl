# Project Name:  Lesson 3 Version Control


## Course Title:
Web Application Development

## Assignment Date:  
February 2, 2018

## Student Name:  
Justin Brown

## Project Description:
This assignment was assigned to get me started with the basics of Github. The reading and lecture notes were assigned to give me an introduction to what we will be doing the rest of the semester using the Version Control Github to add, push, and commit my files.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Github's essential commands that will be the bread and butter are add, commit, and push. Adding a file gets it ready and pushing will backup the file, but it will not be saved until the file is commited. 
2. There are many different types of Version Control systems. Each VCS has their own benefits. Local VCS are easier and cater toward working on projects by yourself while centralized and distributed VCS are better when you are collaborating with other people and makes it easier to work together and keep track of what is going on. 
3. Version control Systems are beneficial to learn and use because it is what a lot of large corporations use to collaborate and work together. By using Github in this course I will be able to share my work with classmates and others by commiting my work to the site making it accessible to others.
